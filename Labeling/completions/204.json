    "text": "lovely find at bandung, really love its industrial sophisticated design with black leather and woody furniture tat matches this wooden building perfectly.  we orderd pineapple + avocado salad, gnocchi with grilled chicken and lamb shank. it's a beautiful concussion of sweet pineapple with soft avocado, what a refreshing appetiser!  the gnocchi was the second surprise. once the plate was served on table, immediately i caught the fragrance of freshly grated parmesan cheese.. i told my hubby, \"i don't need to try it, this dish is gonna be awesome!\" indeed, the complexity and freshness of home-made pesto sauce gave the tender gnocchi the perfect coating. i didn't put high hope on the grilled chicken as it taste hard n tasteless at usual restaurants. i was wrong! the grilled chicken is grilled to perfection, and meat was truly tender. love it. lamb shank was tender n fragrantful too.  really enjoyed our dinner there! a definite 5 from me!!
