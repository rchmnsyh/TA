    "text": "hey everyone! i just got back from school and i was craving some artisan sandwich, so i decided to go and est lunch at mom's.  mom's bakery recently has been my favorite breakfast spot on sunday mornings. and now it seems like i can't get enough of them. but i mean, who doesn't love their sandwiches? i decided to have tempe on multi-grain sourdough dressed in spicy thai peanut sauce. it's vegan and very delicious. trust me when i say that you're going to fall in love so hard with their home-made tempe! ambience-wise, it's a bit tight so usually coming here in the mornings might become a problem since a lot of people like to have breakfast here. but it gives you the homey, rustic feeling; just imagine eating a sandwich that is made by your mom with love."
