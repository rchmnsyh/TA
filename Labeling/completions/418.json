    "text": "i'm not a fan of nanny's pavillon in jakarta, but decided to come here during our stay in bandung after checking it in zomato  the place located in riau next to karnivor. the \"home\" theme really makes this place feels so homey. it has indoor and outdoor seating. outdoor seating with cute white tables and chairs  we ordered :  aglio olio fried rice : came with fried egg and 3 pcs of shrimp. rice too soggy, shrimp a bit too hard  pesto chicken fried rice : better than aglio olio but it could be better if the rice wasn't soggy  chicken salad : chicken was too hard  overall nothing special with the food but i love the ambience, it wasn't too crowdy or noisy. very cool just to relax here"
